                                        Collections - customg note boards : 
                                        in this App you can create diffrent boards - AKA collections
                                        for each collection you can define a different type of time containing diffretns things 
                                        for example, a collection of items conatining code snippets and a todo list, 
										or a collection of items contating a picture you upload and a link with a preview a webite.
                                        you can build an item from this 5 bits:
										1.Text
										2.Link with preview
										3.Code editor
										4.Image display/uploader.
										5. Todo - List
										To use the app you must signup/login, you can use your google account or creart a new one.
										
										You can create as many collections as you want, and as many items as you want, 
										you can favorite items for quick access and search each collection in the top search bar.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Throught the semster I took a few online courses learing React and Graphql,
										I choose to create the app using react and a great online tool called <a href="https://www.graph.cool/">graphcool</a>,
										in graph cool i built the application schema and queried it using Apollo framework.
										it was difficult to design everything using this new framework but it was nice trying.
										I Also chose to use an external authentication service called <a href="http://auth0.com">auth0 </a> so i could integrate
										google users, it was challegeing making all the dependencies and frameworks work together.
										
										But i think the most diffuclt part was making the app responsive.

                                    <p>What was fun:</p>
                                    <p> It was fun thinking of what things I could add to the item and how to design it
									in a way such that adding new bits afterwards will be easy.
